# ITP449_KNN

#### Use KNN model for predicting diabetes

##### 1. Create the Feature Matrix and Target Vector.

##### 2. Develop a KNN based model based on Training for various ks. K should range between 1 and 30.

##### 3. Compute the accuracy for both training and validation for those ks.

##### 4. Plot the training and validation accuracy vs k and determine the best value of k.

##### 5. Using the selected value of k, score the test data set.

##### 6. Plot the confusion matrix as a figure.

##### 7. Predict the Outcome for a person with 2 pregnancies, 150 glucose, 85 blood pressure, 22 skin thickness, 200 insulin, 30 BMI, 0.3 diabetes pedigree, 55 age.
